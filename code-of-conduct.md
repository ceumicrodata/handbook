# Code of conduct

## Behavior

CEU MicroData is a workplace free of any sort of discrimination or harassment. Each member has to comply with the relevant University policies \(see the [CEU Code of Ethics](https://documents.ceu.edu/documents/p-1009-1v2106) and the [CEU Policy on Harassment](https://documents.ceu.edu/documents/p-1402-1v2103)\). To sum up, you must avoid uninvited or unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct directed at an individual's or a group of individuals' supposed or actual nationality, race, ethnicity, language, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, cultural identity, social origin, socioeconomic status, educational level, disability, genetic trait, mental or physical health condition, or any similar ground. We are committed to the principles of free inquiry and free expression, the pursuit of truth wherever it may lead, and to creating an environment that encourages the active exploration and exchange of ideas. We do not intend to impair this freedom. Prohibited harassment, however, is neither protected expression nor the proper exercise of academic freedom.

### Privacy

In general, you should comply with GDPR and the local privacy protection laws. You should ask for explicit consent of each affected person before taking any photos or recordings. You should  ask for explicit consent again in case you intend to share data of any kind on a person with anyone else in any way \(e.g. posting to social media, sending it to a colleague or a friend etc.\). 



## Confidentiality

As a rule of thumb consider any information, research data and material to be confidential unless it has already been made publicly available by MicroData. Any personal data or dataset containing personal information is strictly confidential and should be stored on encrypted medium. In case you intend to share any information or data with any person or organization outside MicroData make sure to obtain a written approval of a Principal Investigator first.

## Scientific Integrity

You must avoid any academic misconduct \(see details in the Code of Ethics, but basically you should report your results honestly and make proper attributions to other people's research and ideas\). You should make sure that any result you report can be reproduced. The best practice is to work in beads. Mistakes are a part of the research process. You will at some point likely make a mistake. The important part is to acknowledge it and to never try to hide it. The integrity of our science is our top priority. Reporting any mistake immediately helps us fixing it sooner and avoiding making similar mistakes in the future.  

## Reporting

If you notice or experience any violation of the basic rules outlined above, please notify Miklos immediately. If Miklos is the cause of your concern, please notify Adam. If you have any suggestions on how we should operate or further improve our culture you are always welcome to share it on the meetings or privately with any PI or Project Manager.
