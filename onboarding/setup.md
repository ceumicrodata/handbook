# Setup

This is a comprehensive list of what you are going to need throughout these lessons. To participate in the MicroData workflow, you will need access to the software described below. In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser. The Carpemtries maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors that may be useful on the [Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions).We will go into details after a quick overview:

> ### Key requirements
>
> * Python 3 installation with pip3 and virtualenv
> * BEAD executable
> * Git installation, Git Bash on Windows

Let's go through them one by one.

## The Bash Shell

Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple tasks more quickly.

## Git

Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your code on [github.com](https://github.com/). You will need a [supported web browser](https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/).

 You will need an account at [github.com](https://github.com/) for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already. Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For example, you may want to review these [instructions for keeping your email address private](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/) provided at GitHub.

## Text Editor

When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is optimized for writing code, with features like automatic color-coding of key words. The default text editor on macOS and Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being intuitive. If you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, hit the `Esc` key, followed by `:`+`Q`+`!` \(colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark\), then hitting `Return` to return to the shell.

## Stata

In MicroData we use Stata 16 MP. If you do not have a Stata license, please let your instructor know so that they can request one for you.

If you are newly installing Stata on your computer, follow these instructions.

## Python 3

If you use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer, you are good to go. Otherwise you should visit [Python's official page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest python version for your operating system. Always follow the installation guide on Python's website.
