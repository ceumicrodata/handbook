# Julia

## Julia startup and install

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language, still designed to be fast and productive, for e.g. data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, modeling and simulation, most commonly used for numerical analysis and computational science.

Recomended to start Julia from your haflinger workspace. 

You can start Julia from VNC terminal or VS code terminal or by ssh connection by: 

`julia` 

or even better to start as `julia --project`
[Julia CML](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/command-line-interface/)

If you log in to you CEU account you can find basic tutorials with [Julia LinkedinLearning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-julia?u=139332290)

### Recomended extensions for server usage:

[Kezdi.jl](https://github.com/codedthinking/Kezdi.jl) is a Julia package that provides a Stata-like interface for data manipulation and analysis. It is designed to be easy to use for Stata users who are transitioning to Julia.1

[IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) is a Julia-language backend combined with the Jupyter interactive environment (also used by IPython).
