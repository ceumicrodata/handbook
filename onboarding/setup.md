# Setup

This is a comprehensive list of what you are going to need throughout these lessons. To participate in the MicroData workflow, you will need access to the software described below. In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser. The Carpemtries maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors that may be useful on the [Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions).We will go into details after a quick overview:

> ### Key requirements
>
> * Python 3 installation with pip3 and virtualenv
> * BEAD executable
> * Git installation, Git Bash on Windows

Let's go through them one by one.

## The Bash Shell

Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple tasks more quickly.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="MacOS" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Python 3

If you use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer, you are good to go. Otherwise you should visit [Python's official page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest python version for your operating system. Always follow the installation guide on Python's website.
